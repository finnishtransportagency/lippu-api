# API
General documentation for the Lippu-API. The
[Lippu-API swagger-definition](../yaml/api.yml) has detailed
definitions and descriptions for the requests and responses.

## Authentication flow
The authentication flow uses public-private key cryptography (see
below for the sequence diagram of the authentication process). Authentication
requires the client side to register their public key to the server side
before attempting to authenticate. As this is public key, it can be send via
email or have some other procedure for this.

In the first step, the client initiates the authentication process by sending
*AuthenticationInitRequest* to the server. The server generates a server side nonce for the client,
stores it and responds with *AuthenticationInitResponse*. The client then generates
a client side nonce and calculates cryptographic signature for base64 encoded
value of the nonces (see section Signature and verification).
Client sends *AuthenticationRequest* to the server, server
verifies the client's nonce is still valid and then verifies the
the signature using the client's public key.
If the signature is valid, server responds with *AuthenticationResponse*, which
has a authentication token, which can be used to

### Signature and verification
This process is similar on server side and client side. The signature is created
by catenating the server side nonce and client side nonce together.
The result is then encoded with base64 and then signed with client's
private key. Signature verification is similar, server catenates
the nonces and base64 encodes the result.
The server can verify the signature using the signature, the client's public key and
the base64 value of nonces. It is suggested to use at least 2048 bit RSA keys and SHA256 algorithm
for the signature.


## Ticket reservation flow
The ticket reservation is three part process:
1. Product query
2. Availability query
3. Reservation

All the querys require authentication token from the
authentication flow. The token is sent in a http header.
The sequence diagram for the ticket reservation
flow is below.

![Reservation flow sequence](uml/reservation_flow.png "Reservation flow sequence")

### Product query (GET)
Product query retrieves the available products from the travel transportation
service. Client can limit the query results by date, coordinates and required
accessibility features. The server responds with the products that satisfy
the query parameters, its accessibility features, extra services available
and passenger categories available for the product.

### Availability query (POST)
After having the products, the client can query if the travel transportation
service has the capacity to fulfill travel requirements. The query will have:
* travel information, from where (coordinate or stop id), to where (coordinate or stop id)
* travel time 
* passenger information (passenger category, extra services, accessibility services)
* contract identifier
* optional requirements for accessibility features and extra services 

If the server has capasity to fulfill the travel, it will do a soft booking
for the travel, meaning the booking is valid for a short period of time
to complete the reservation before expiring.
Then the server responds with the case id for whote reservation,
reservation ids for the individual travels and how long the soft
booked reservation is valid. The individual travel information also
has information about the accessibility requirements and extra service
features. The response also has the transport vehicle information.
The *travelEntitlementId* must uniquely identify the travel to the
travel transport service and case id uniquely identify the whole reservation.

### Reservation (POST)
If the customer accepts the offered booking, permanent reservation
is made. The client sends the confirmed reservations by sending
the reservation request to the server with optional customer information.
The server responds with the ticket payloads and ticket type information
for the reservations and travelEntitlement ids, which the client can
forward to the customer/end user.

## Cancellation of the reservation (DELETE)
Client can cancel the reservation by sending *DELETE* request to
the reservation endpoint with the case id. This will cancel every
reserved travelEntitlement related to this reservation. To cancel
individual travelEntitlement, see the section *Cancellation of the travel
entitlement (DELETE)*.

## Travel entitlement
The *travelEntitlement* API endpoint is for manipulating individual
*TravelEntitlements* after they have been reserved. There are three
operations *travelEntitlement*: status, cancellation and activation.

### Status of the travel entitlement (GET) 
This request will return the status of the *TravelEntitlement*
identified by *travelEntitlementId*. This includes ticket attributes,
validity time of the *TravelEntitlement* and status of the 

### Cancellation of the travel entitlement (DELETE)
This operation will cancel the *TravelEntitlement* identified by
*travelEntitlementId*.

### Activation of the travel entitlement (POST)
This request will activate the *travelEntitlement*
identified by *travelEntitlementId*. This is useful when the activation
must be done by the customer instead of a conductor or a driver
or a machine. The request will return the *travelEntitlement*
information after the activation or error response.

## Payment 
Payment for tickets is outside of the scope of the project.
For payment, there exists already options in other channels.

## Ticket format
This specification does not dictate any format for the tickets, but
it has field to transfer the payload and attribute to indicate
ticket format type (attribute is *ticketType*). This way multiple
different ticket formats are supported. The parties can decide a
suitable ticket format, so that the tickets can be validated
by the travel transport operator and shown by the device customer has.

## Accessibility and extra services
The API has attribute, type of a enumareted list, to describe
which accessibility features transport service's
products support. In addition to the enumarated list,
descriptions can be attached to them. At the minunum
tranport service should use the **UNKNOWN** value
to let users know that information in unavailable.
The list of the accessibility features was retrieved
from National Access Point (NAP) definitions
(a project by Finnish Transport Agency).

Transport service can also support variable extra services.
These have not been formally defined, implementors can
describe relevant extra services they support.
